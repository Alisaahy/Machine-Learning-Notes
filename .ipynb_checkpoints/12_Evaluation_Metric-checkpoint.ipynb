    "\n",
    "We compare the cumulative percentage of customers who are responders with the cumulative percentage of customers contacted in the marketing campaign across the groups. This describes the ‘gain’ in targeting a given percentage of the total number of customers using the highest modelled probabilities of responding, rather than targeting them at random.\n",

    "Dashed line corresponds with “no gain”, i.e., what we would expect to achieve by contacting customers at random. The closer the cumulative gains line is to the top-left corner of the chart, the greater the gain; the higher the proportion of the responders that are reached for the lower proportion of customers contacted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the **costs** associated with sending each piece of direct mail and the expected revenue from each responder, the cumulative gains chart can be used to **decide upon the optimum number** of customers to contact. There will likely be a tipping point at which we have reached a sufficiently high proportion of responders, and where the costs of contacting a greater proportion of customers are too great given the diminishing returns. This will generally correspond with a **flattening-off** of the cumulative gains curve, where further contacts (corresponding with additional deciles) are not expected to provide many additional responders.\n",

    "**Lift Chart**\n",
    "\n",
    "Shows the actual lift.\n",
    "\n",
    "To plot the chart: Calculate the points on the lift curve by determining the ratio between the result predicted by our model and the result using no model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: For contacting 10% of customers, using no model we should get 10% of responders and using the given model we should get 30% of responders. The y-value of the lift curve at 10% is 30 / 10 = 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we want the lift curve to extend as high as possible into the top-left corner of the figure, indicating that we have a large lift associated with contacting a small proportion of customers.\n",

    "**Why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cumulative gains and lift curves are a simple and useful approach to understand what returns you are likely to get from running a marketing campaign and how many customers you should contact, based on targeting the most promising customers using a predictive model."

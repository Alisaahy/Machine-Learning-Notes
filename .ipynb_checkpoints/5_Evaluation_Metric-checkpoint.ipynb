Calculating **null accuracy** is a good way to know the minimum we should achieve with our models. In this case, since only 3.33% of the individuals in the training sample defaulted, a simple but useless classifier that always predicts that each individual will not default, regardless of his or her credit card balance and student status, will result in an error rate of 3.33%. Therefore, the trivial **null classifier** will achieve an error rate that is only a bit higher than the LDA training set error rate.

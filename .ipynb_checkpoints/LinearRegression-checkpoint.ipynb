    " - For instance, consider an example in which p = 100 and H_0 : β1 = β2 = · · · = βp = 0 is true, so no variable is truly associated with the response. In this situation, about 5% of the p-values associated with each variable will be below 0.05 by chance. In other words, we expect to see approximately five small p-value even in the absence of any true association. Hence, if we use the individual t-statistics and associated p-values to decide whether there is any association between the variables and the response, high chance we will incorrectly conclude there is a relationship. \n",
    " - However, the F-statistic does not suffer from this problem because it adjusts for the number of predictors. If H_0 is true, there's only a 5% chance that the F-statistic will result in a p-value below 0.05, regardless of the number of predictors or the number of observations.\n",

    "We can perform variable selection by trying out a lot of different models, each containing a different subset of the predictors. There're 3 classical approaches for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Forward selection:** we begin with the empty model (like for linear regression, begin with model contains an intercept but no predictors). We test the impact of adding variables one by one, using a chosen model fit criterion  for judgement(like adjusted R2 for regression model). We then add the variable whose inclusion gives the most significant improvement of the fit (like the variable which results in the lowest RSS), and repeating this process until some stopping rules is satisfied, like no variables can improve the model to a significant extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backward selection:** we start with all variables in the model, testing the deletion of each variable using a chosen model fit criterion. Delete the variable whose loss gives the most insignificant loss to the model fit. For linear regression, we can remove the variale with the largest p-value, re-fit the model and repeat the procedure until a stopping rule is reached, like all remaining varibales have a p-value below some threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mixed selection:** this is a combination of forward and backward selection. We start with no variables in the moel, as with forward selection, we add the variable that provides the best fit and continue this procedure one-by-one. As we know that, like in linear regression, the p-value for some variables can become larger as new predictors are added. This is because forward selection is a **greedy approach**, and might include variables early that later bome redundant. We can remedy this by removing that variable from the model and continue to perform these forward and backward steps until all variables in the model have a sufficiently low p-value, and all variables outside the model would have a larg p-value if added to the model.\n",

    "1. The instance probability we want to derive is $p(C_k|X) = p(C_k|x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$, which is the posterior probability of class ($C_k$, target) given predictor vector $X = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$. According to the Bayes Theorem, the posterior probability can be represented as:\n",

But to calculate each $p(x_i|C_k)$, we can't simply use a frequency-based probability. When a frequency-based probability is zero, it will wipe out all the information in the other probabilities. A solution would be **Laplace smoothing**, which is a technique for smoothing categorical data. With the lapalce smoothing. The resulting estimate will be between the empirical probability (relative frequency) $\\frac{x_i}{N}$, and the uniform probability $\\frac{1}{d}$. Usually, we use $\\alpha = 1$\n",

    "# Types of Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multinomial Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "This is mostly used for **document classification** problem, i.e whether a document belongs to the category of sports, politics, technology etc. We can use the frequency of the words present in the document as predictors. To make your classifier more advanced, tf-idf is also an ideal option . Tf-idf not only counts the occurrence of a word in the given text(or document), but also reflect **inverse document frequency**, which is a measure of how much information the word provides. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bernoulli Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to the multinomial naive bayes but the predictors are **boolean variables**. The parameters that we use to predict the class variable take up only values yes or no, for example if a word occurs in the text or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "When the predictors take up a **continuous** value and are not discrete, we assume that these values are sampled from a gaussian distribution."

    "# Advantages and Disadvantages of Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In spite of its simplicity and the strict independence assumptions, the **Naive Bayes classifier performs surprisingly well** for classification on many real-world tasks and you **need less training data**. This is because the violation of the independence assumption tends not to hurt classification performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Naive Bayes is that it is naturally an **“incremental learner”.** An incremental learner is an induction technique that can update its model one training example at a time. It does not need to reprocess all past training examples when new training data become available.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It is easy and fast to predict class of test data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The probability estimation from Naive Bayes will be quite **inaccurate**. It will **overestimated** for the correct class and **underestimated** for the incorrect classes. This does become a problem, though, if we’re going to be using the probability estimates themselves—so Naive Bayes should be used with caution for actual decision-making with costs and benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It perform well in case of **categorical input variables** compared to numerical variable(s). For numerical variable, normal distribution is assumed (bell curve, which is a strong assumption)."

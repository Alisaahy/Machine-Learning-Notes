For this reason, it is important to run the algorithm multiple times from **different random initial configurations**. Then one selects the best solution, i.e. that for which the **within-cluster variation** is smallest.\n",

    "> - If Euclidean distance is used, then shoppers who have bought very few items overall (i.e. infrequent users of the online shopping site) will be clustered together. This may not be desirable. \n",
    "> -  If correlation-based distance is used, then shoppers with similar preferences (e.g. shoppers who have bought items A and B but never items C or D) will be clustered together, even if some shoppers with these preferences are higher-volume shoppers than others. Therefore, for this application, correlation-based distance may be a better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also consider whether or not the variables should be normalized before the dissimilarity between the observations is computed.\n",

    "> High-frequency purchases like socks therefore tend to have a much larger effect on the inter-shopper dissimilarities, and hence on the clustering ultimately obtained, than rare purchases like computers. This may not be desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - If the variables are scaled before the inter-observation dissimilarities are computed, then each variable will in effect be given equal importance in the hierarchical clustering performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - We might also want to scale the variables if they are measured on different scales; otherwise, the choice of units (e.g. centimeters versus kilometers) for a particular variable will greatly affect the dissimilarity measure obtained. "

    "# Other Considerations: Outliers / perturbations\n",
    "\n",
    "Both K-means and hierarchical clustering will assign each observation to a cluster. However, sometimes this might not be appropriate. For instance, suppose that most of the observations truly belong to a small number of (unknown) subgroups, and a **small subset** of the observations are **quite different** from each other and from all other observations. Then since K- means and hierarchical clustering force every observation into a cluster, the clusters found may be heavily distorted due to the presence of outliers that do not belong to any cluster.\n",

For instance, suppose that we cluster n observations, and then cluster the observations again after removing a subset of the n observations at random. One would hope that the two sets of clusters ob- tained would be quite similar, but often this is not the case! Since clustering can be non-robust, we recommend clustering subsets of the data in order to get a sense of the robustness of the clusters obtained. \n",
